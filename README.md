# TOP Project Recipes
 Repository for The Odin Project's Recipes Website assigment
 
 This was created as a way to practice creating a website using only HTML5 and CSS.
 
 This was also my first real try on developing a website from scratch, so it may have some redudant or non-efficient coding.

 It also isnt responsive yet, so it pretty much hasnt any smaller windows sizes compatibility outside of 1920x1080px.
 
 You can access the live version of the website on the following link: https://franciscomateus0119.github.io/TOP-Project-Recipes/

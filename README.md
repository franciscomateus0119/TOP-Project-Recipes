# TOP Project Recipes
 Repository for The Odin Project's Recipes Website assigment
 
 This was created as a way to practice creating a website using only HTML5 and CSS.
 
 This was also my first real try on developing a website from scratch, so it may have some redudant or non-efficient coding.
 
 You can access the live version of the website on the following link: https://franciscomateus0119.github.io/TOP-Project-Recipes/
